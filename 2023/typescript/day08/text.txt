Subject: Code Changes Needed

Hello beloved team!

Looks like we need some changes to the code again!

1. there are sometimes naughty kids in the same list
1. turns out I don't actually need to see the nice children in the list, after all
1. my golf game ran late this morning.. so since the other two changes were quick to implement, I'm sure this will be just as fast!
